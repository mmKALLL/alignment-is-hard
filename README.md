# Alignment is Hard

Alignment is Hard is a high-stakes resource management strategy game about making interesting and meaningful input-random decisions. It addresses a bone I have with mobile strategy games: they tend to be consistently clearable with simple heuristics.

This game on the other hand is designed to hone into the core of what makes strategic decisions interesting: they should affect things without being obvious, be asymmetric to prevent heuristics, input-random to prevent memorization, simple enough to understand at a glance, yet layered enough to make first-order optimization obviously bad.
